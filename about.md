I am a first year PhD Candidate in Statistical Science at Duke University.  My research interests are broadly in time series, machine learning and Bayesian Statistics.  I am especially interested in applying machine learning models to the algorithmic composition of music.

I recieved my Masters in Statistics from Duke in May 2017, and prior to Duke, I studied Physics and Math at the University of Virginia.
