I am a third year PhD Candidate in Statistical Science at [Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu/) working with [Sayan Mukherjee](https://sayanmuk.github.io), [Mike West](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mw/) and [Peter Hoff](https://pdhoff.github.io).  My research interests are broadly in time series, machine learning and Bayesian Statistics.  Current research projects focus on probabilistic modeling for complex time series.
