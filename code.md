## Network Analysis of Concert Programming
Additive and Multiplicative Effects network models are applied to the Boston Symphony Orchestra's concert programming. Composer level effects are explored to determine which traits make two composers more likely to be programmed in the same concert together. [[Report]({{ site.url }}/Yanchenko_aky5_Final.pdf)] 

## Music Generation with Factorial Hidden Markov Models
This project explored the use of Factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs) to compose classical piano music.  Three different inference algorithms are implemented and compared. The generated pieces tend to be more "original" than pieces generated with basic hidden Markov models, however, the generated pieces still lack in long-term structure.[Code](https://github.com/aky4wn/Sta863_FHMM), [Report]({{ site.url }}/Yanchenko_FHMM_Report.pdf), [Generated Sample 1]({{ site.url }}/pachelbel_FHMM-GAM.mp3) and [Generated Sample 2]({{ site.url }}/pachelbel_FHMM-SVI.mp3).

## NCAA Basketball Tournament Prediction
Various machine learning models are used to try to predict the outcome of the NCAA Men's basketball tournament.  Five different models are implemented and compared, using previous tournament results and current season statistics on each team. In 2019, the majority vote of the models implemented correctly predicted 80% of the tournament games.  

## Polyphonic Music Generation with Dynamic Dependency Network Models 
Dynamic Dependency Network Models (DDNMs) are used to model a four part piano piece, which each voice modeled distinctly.  The DDNM models are succesful at capturing some of the harmony and dependencies between the voices. [Report]({{ site.url }}/Yanchenko_aky5_Sta642_Report.pdf) and [Generated Sample]({{ site.url }}/DDNM.mp3).

## Latent Dirichlet Allocation
Latent Dirichlet Allocation is implemented from scratch in Python. The implementation is analyzed and applied to movie review data as an example. [[Code](https://github.com/aky4wn/663FinalProject)].

## R Coding Projects
Various R programming projects, including predicting US airline delays ([Code](https://github.com/aky4wn/Predictive-Modeling---Airline-Delays)), comparing NYC boroughs ([Code](https://github.com/aky4wn/NYC-Boroughs-Modeling)), building a simple Shiny application ([Code](https://github.com/aky4wn/Shiny-Bayesian-Analysis)), exploring grpahs in R ([Code](https://github.com/aky4wn/Graphs-in-R)) and using web scraping methods to analyze the locations of restaurants and hotels ([Code](https://github.com/aky4wn/Web-Scraping)).
