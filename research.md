- Algorithmic Composition: [Classical Music Composition Using State Space Models](https://aky4wn.github.io/Classical-Music-Composition-Using-State-Space-Models/).  We use HMMs and TVAR models to compose classical piano pieces from the Romantic era.  This work was conducted as part of my Masters thesis at Duke.
