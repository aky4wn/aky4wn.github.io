One of my long-term research goals is the generative modeling of classical, orchestral music. The successful modeling of orchestral classical music is an important challenge with applications to many disciplines.  Orchestral classical music is a complex, multivariate time series that is highly structured, both temporally (in terms of melody) and vertically (in terms of harmony).  There are complex dependencies between different instruments, and thus there is a high level of structure both within the part of a single instrument and between instruments.  Music is a long-memory process, with long-term structure over multiple minutes in full orchestral works.  Additionally, the modeling of music is challenging from a data perspective, as there is very little labeled data and it is expensive to obtain, necessitating unsupervised approaches.  Audio data, in particular, while of high interest, is challenging to annotate and label in its raw form. However, music theory provides a source of *ground truth* to assess and validate results.
